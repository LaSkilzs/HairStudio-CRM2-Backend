1,Reluctant Groomers,"Reluctant groomers can be awkward clients, as they are often ill at ease in the salon environment, and it can be hard for a stylist to convince them to explore other available options such as coloring or the use of finish products. They may not visit a stylist until their hair is in desperate need of a cut. The reluctant groomer will generally opt for the most basic of options in the salon, for example just a wet cut."
2,Prioritizer,"Whilst valuing their appearance, maintaining or creating a new hairstyle can be low down on the priority list. Salon visits are probably a rare moment of self-indulgence"
3,CareFree,"Younger clients, for example those aged 18-24, may visit a salon hoping for inspiration and are easily influenced by a knowledgeable stylist. Often this age group have few responsibilities, they want to experiment and have the confidence to carry it off! This client type will value your suggestions and be open to using new products and styling methods."
4,Career-Focused,"Career-focused clients are confident and have definite ideas on hairstyling, which fit in with a corporate or projected image. They are frequent visitors to the salon and are experienced in the world of hair and beauty. They know how they want to be treated and this can be a little intimidating for junior stylists. This type of client is strongly influenced by fashion and reads quality magazines for styling inspiration and the latest essential looks."
5,Sporty,"Active sportsmen and women tend to choose uncomplicated short hairstyles, or long hair that can easily be styled into a ponytail. Fashion taste veers toward casual and comfortable sportswear. Sporty types may have to wash their hair often, perhaps twice a day, and are more likely to shower than bathe, preferring to use refreshing, practical, uncomplicated products that work."
6,Elegant,"Elegance is all about poise and bearing, it is simple yet sophisticated, graceful and stylish. Elegant clients may want short, choppy cuts, or wear their hair long with an emphasis on up-dos, or let it down to create movement and energy."
7,Trend-Inspired,"These clients have their fingers on the pulse, and they are able to communicate their hair styling needs effectively. During consultation it may be necessary to keep focused to ensure you are both in agreement on a styling direction. Trend-inspired clients will want to change their hairstyle on a regular basis to match the seasonâ€™s new look and new products: those with a unique and innovative quality are particularly attractive."
8,Introvert,"Introverted clients can be inward looking, are often reserved and can be more thoughtful and contemplative than expressive and outspoken. They may veer toward safe choices regarding both hairstyling and clothing. Hair may often be functionally styled, as opposed to choosing a specific look to make a style statement. "
